= Recommended etcd practices

For large and dense clusters, etcd may suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows excessively large and exceeds the space quota. Periodic maintaince of etcd including defragmentaion needs to be done to free up space in the data store. It is highly recommended to monitor Prometheus for etcd metrics and defrag it when needed before etcd raises a cluster-wide alarm that puts the cluster into a maintenance mode which only accepts key reads and deletes. Some of the key metrics to monitor are `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes` which is the current quota limit, `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes` which indicates the actual database usage after a history compaction while `etcd_debugging_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes` which shows the database size including free space waiting for defragmentation.
