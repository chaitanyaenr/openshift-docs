= Recommended practices for scaling the cluster

The cluster can be scaled by increasing or decreasing the replicas in the worker machinesets 
as documented in xref:../../machine_management/modifying-machineset.adoc#modifying-machineset[{product-title} modifying machineset].
When scaling up the cluster to higher node counts it's recommended to spread the nodes across
all the available zones for higher availability. If the replicas in the machinesets are set to
higher numbers at once, the controller might have issues creating the machines depending on the
number of requests the cloud platform on top of which {product-title} is deployed is able to 
handle as the controller will start to loop more trying to create, check and update the machines 
with the status. So, it is recommended to scale up the cluster by 25-50 nodes at a time in order 
to get to higher node counts.
